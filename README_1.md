## About the project
***
The service provides the ability to order goods from several stores. The catalog of goods, information on prices and availability are loaded from files of a single format.

The user collects an order by adding products from different stores presented in a single catalog. If one product is in stock in several stores, you can choose which one to add. Since prices in stores may vary, this will also affect the amount of the order.

After confirming the order on the confirmation page, the order is stored in the database with the status "New".

> adv: In the admin panel, you can view all orders and change their status
